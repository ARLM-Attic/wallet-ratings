=Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Criteria Weighting=

This document outlines the OBPP criteria rating method.

==Weights==

Weights are qualitative estimates of importance which are used to compare individual criteria and calculate a final score. The weight is an estimate of the severity of the attack prevented by each countermeasure.

The weight for each criterion is derived using a four-step process:

# Each attacker is assigned a score representing its relative importance compared to other attackers.
# For each attacker, every category of attacks they can perform is assigned a score representing its relative importance compared to other categories.
# Within each category, every sub-category (quality, usability, and feedback) is assigned a score representing its relative importance compared to other sub-categories in the same category.
# When multiple questions cover the same sub-category, they are assigned a score representing its relative importance compared to other questions in the same sub-category.

The final score for each question is the product of the four percentages listed above.

==Acceptance Criteria==

The final scores for every test item should reflect the following conditions:

* Weights should reflect the number of attackers (many vs few) capable of performing an attack.
* Weights should reflect the temporal window of opportunity (long vs short) for the attack.
* Weights should reflect the success probability for the attack.
* Weights should reflect the amount of information obtained by the attack.
