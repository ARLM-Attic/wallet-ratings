Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Ratings Criteria
=======================================

This document outlines the OBPP criteria for rating the privacy strength of Bitcoin wallets. Each item represents an objectively-measurable test of how well a rated wallet implements countermeasures for the attacks identified in the [threat model](threat model.wiki). The result of each test is converted into a numeric score via a method decribed below or in the [methodology](methodology.md).

Our metrics are based on feature completeness and user experience. To evaluate user experience, we utilize a "minimum number of clicks to perform action" metric. This metric is easily standardized between wallets, minimizes subjectivity, and can be measured by a single tester.

Each sub-category of privacy, such as "Receiving address management," is broken down into between one and three areas of consideration, including usability, quality, and user feedback.
